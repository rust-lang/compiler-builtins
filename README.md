# `compiler-builtins`

> Porting `compiler-rt` intrinsics to Rust

See [rust-lang/rust#35437][0].

[0]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/35437

## When and how to use this crate?

If you are working with a target that doesn't have binary releases of std
available via rustup (this probably means you are building the core crate
yourself) and need compiler-rt intrinsics (i.e. you are probably getting linker
errors when building an executable: `undefined reference to __aeabi_memcpy`),
you can use this crate to get those intrinsics and solve the linker errors. To
do that, add this crate somewhere in the dependency graph of the crate you are
building:

```toml
# Cargo.toml
[dependencies]
compiler_builtins = { git = "https://github.com/rust-lang/compiler-builtins" }
```

```rust
extern crate compiler_builtins;

// ...
```

If you still get an "undefined reference to $INTRINSIC" error after that change,
that means that we haven't ported `$INTRINSIC` to Rust yet! Please open [an
issue] with the name of the intrinsic and the LLVM triple (e.g.
thumbv7m-none-eabi) of the target you are using. That way we can prioritize
porting that particular intrinsic.

If you've got a C compiler available for your target then while we implement
this intrinsic you can temporarily enable a fallback to the actual compiler-rt
implementation as well for unimplemented intrinsics:

```toml
[dependencies.compiler_builtins]
git = "https://github.com/rust-lang/compiler-builtins"
features = ["c"]
```

## Contributing

1. Pick one or more intrinsics from the [pending list](#progress).
2. Fork this repository.
3. Port the intrinsic(s) and their corresponding [unit tests][1] from their
   [C implementation][2] to Rust.
4. Add a test to compare the behavior of the ported intrinsic(s) with their
   implementation on the testing host.
5. Add the intrinsic to `examples/intrinsics.rs` to verify it can be linked on
   all targets.
6. Send a Pull Request (PR).
7. Once the PR passes our extensive testing infrastructure, we'll merge it!
8. Celebrate :tada:

### Porting Reminders

1. [Rust][5a] and [C][5b] have slightly different operator precedence. C evaluates comparisons (`== !=`) before bitwise operations (`& | ^`), while Rust evaluates the other way.
2. C assumes wrapping operations everywhere. Rust panics on overflow when in debug mode. Consider using the [Wrapping][6] type or the explicit [wrapping_*][7] functions where applicable.
3. Note [C implicit casts][8], especially integer promotion. Rust is much more explicit about casting, so be sure that any cast which affects the output is ported to the Rust implementation.
4. Rust has [many functions][9] for integer or floating point manipulation in the standard library. Consider using one of these functions rather than porting a new one.

## Testing

The easiest way to test locally is using Docker. This can be done by running
`./ci/run-docker.sh [target]`. If no target is specified, all targets will be
run.

In order to run the full test suite, you will also need the C compiler runtime
to test against, located in a directory called `compiler-rt`. This can be
obtained with the following:

```sh
curl -L -o rustc-llvm-18.0.tar.gz https://github.com/rust-lang/llvm-project/archive/rustc/18.0-2024-02-13.tar.gz
tar xzf rustc-llvm-18.0.tar.gz --strip-components 1 llvm-project-rustc-18.0-2024-02-13/compiler-rt
```

Local targets may also be tested with `./ci/run.sh [target]`.

Note that testing may not work on all hosts, in which cases it is acceptable to
rely on CI.
